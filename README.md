# Demotic-Font
## A public repository for my project to create an encoding and font for Egyptian Demotic.

I've created this repository in the interest of conducting this work with full transparency 
and to encourage participation at some future point when things have reached a more-finished state.
Once the font has been created, the repository will provide access to all data used to generate it
and make the methodology available to scientific scrutiny.

At present, this is still very much a work in progress, and the imperfectly organized state of the repository reflects this state of affairs.
Nevertheless, please feel free to email me with any questions or comments or to ask for help using any part of the project.
